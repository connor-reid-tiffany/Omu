# Omu
Metabolomics analysis R package

## Introduction to Omu

Omu is an R package that enables rapid analysis of Metabolomics data sets, and the creation of intuitive graphs. Omu can assign metabolite classes (Carbohydrates, Lipids, etc) as meta data, perform t tests, anovas and principle component analysis, and gather functional orthology and gene names from the KEGG database that are associated with the metabolites in a dataset. This package was developed with inexperienced R users in mind.
